# Contributing to OG Tech Minds

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Here's how to get started:

## Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository  
2. **Create a new branch** (`feature/something` or `fix/something`)  
3. **Make your changes**  
4. **Commit and push**  
5. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** against the `main` branch  
6. Wait for review â€” once approved, your changes will be merged and **automatically deployed via Vercel** ðŸš€

## Guidelines

- Follow existing file structure & naming conventions
- Avoid pushing directly to `main`
- Keep PRs small and focused
- If unsure, open an **Issue** first to discuss

Happy contributing! ðŸŽ‰
